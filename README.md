When you navigate to our website, it prompts the user if it can use their current location. Once user accepts, our website does the following on load:
Website checks the current weather for the userâ€™s current location
Utilizing the weather data and AI, website asks user questions that eventually lead to suggesting the user an activity to do in the given location
This would involve potentially using Google Maps API to suggest places to go and activities to do given the current location and weather.
Potential APIs that will be utilized: Weather API, ChatGPT API, and Google Maps API
Intended Users: Anyone who is having trouble finding something to do
